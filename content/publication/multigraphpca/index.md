abstract: Linear regression for high dimensional data is an inherently challenging problem with many solutions generally involving some structural assumption on the model such as lassoâ€™s sparsity in the parameter vector. Considering the random design setting, we apply a different sparsity assumption - sparsity in the covariance or precision matrix of the predictors. Thus, we propose a new regression estimator by first applying methods for estimating a sparse covariance or precision matrix. This matrix is then incorporated into the estimator for the regression parameters.

 We mainly compare this methodology against the classic ridge or Tikhonov regularization method.
