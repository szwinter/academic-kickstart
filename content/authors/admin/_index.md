I am a PhD student in the Statistical Science Department at Duke University, advised by [David Dunson]([https://stat.duke.edu/people/david-b-dunson](https://www.daviddunson.com/)). My research focuses on developing methods for analyzing complex real-world data that faithfully represent uncertainty with minimal assumptions. We are particularly motivated by applications in connectomics and multi-omics.
