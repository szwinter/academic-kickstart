I'm currently pursing a Master's in Statistical Science at Duke University under the guidance of [David Dunson](https://stat.duke.edu/people/david-b-dunson). My primary research focuses on developing novel statistical methods to link brain imaging data to expressed traits, such as linguistic ability or fluid intelligence. Off campus, I split my free time between travelling, kickboxing, and reading fiction.
