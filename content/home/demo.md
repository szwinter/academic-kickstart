Mental health presents unique clinical challenges: the correspondence between afflictions and symptoms is frustratingly inconsistent. A fixed mental illness or mood disorder is often associated with a wide variety of symptoms, and typically only a small subset of these manifest in any one patient. This lack of identifiability hampers treatment.

Resolving the identifiability problem is a long term goal of my research. Short term, I am developing novel methods for relating multi-resolution connectome data to expressed human behaviour. Connectome data is a type of network data that summarizes connections between groups of neurons on the first few layers of the cortical surface; multi-resolution connectome data accommodates networks with different numbers of nodes, allowing for more accurate, robust analysis.
